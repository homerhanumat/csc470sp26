You will solve some problems from the online textbook
"Beginning Computer Science With R", whihc is located at this
URL:

https://homerhanumat.github.io/r-notes/

Specifically, you will work Exercises 1, 2, 3, and 4 from Chapter 6.

The exercises are found here:

https://homerhanumat.github.io/r-notes/060-simulation.html#exercises

You may use the Hints provided in the Exercises, if you are able to access
the links associated with them and if they prove to be

When you are done, gnerate a Quarto file called CSC115_Ch06.qmd.

The YAML front matter for the file should be as follows:

---
title: 'Homework Chapter 6'
author: "Databot"
format:
  html:
    toc: true
    toc-depth: 3
    embed-resources: true
execute: 
  error: true
  warning: false
---

Here are some requirements for the Quarto formatting:

* Each Exercise is in a section (one hashtag #).
* For each erxercise, a subsection (##) devoted to a statement of the problem
* and another subsection (##) for your solution.
* If you are writing a function, the function-definition
  goes in its own chunk.
* Tests of functions go in separate code chunks.
