## Introduction

This report presents an analysis of the `m111survey` dataset, which appears to be survey data collected from a statistics class. The dataset contains `r nrow(m111survey)` observations with `r ncol(m111survey)` variables, including demographic information, lifestyle habits, and personal beliefs.

Our analysis focuses on:

1. Exploring the overall structure and characteristics of the dataset
2. Comparing driving speeds between males and females
3. Examining the relationship between GPA and fastest speed driven

## Data Exploration

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
```

### Dataset Structure

Let's examine the first few rows and get an overview of the data:

```{r}
head(m111survey)
```

```{r}
glimpse(m111survey)
```

### Summary Statistics

```{r}
summary(m111survey)
```

**Key Observations:**

- The dataset contains `r nrow(m111survey)` survey respondents
- Variables include height measurements, sleep patterns, driving behavior, weight perception, beliefs, seating preferences, GPA, and gender
- There are `r sum(m111survey$sex == "female", na.rm = TRUE)` females and `r sum(m111survey$sex == "male", na.rm = TRUE)` males
- Most respondents (`r sum(m111survey$enough_Sleep == "no", na.rm = TRUE)` out of `r nrow(m111survey)`) report not getting enough sleep
- Average sleep duration is approximately `r round(mean(m111survey$sleep, na.rm = TRUE), 1)` hours
- Very few missing values overall (2 for ideal height, 1 for GPA, 2 for diff.ideal.act.)

## Gender Comparison: Fastest Speeds

One interesting question is whether males and females differ in the fastest speeds they report having driven.

### Summary Statistics by Gender

```{r}
speed_by_gender <- m111survey |>
  group_by(sex) |>
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_speed = mean(fastest),
    median_speed = median(fastest),
    sd_speed = sd(fastest),
    min_speed = min(fastest),
    max_speed = max(fastest)
  )

speed_by_gender
```

Males report driving faster on average (`r round(speed_by_gender$mean_speed[speed_by_gender$sex == "male"], 1)` mph) compared to females (`r round(speed_by_gender$mean_speed[speed_by_gender$sex == "female"], 1)` mph), a difference of approximately `r round(speed_by_gender$mean_speed[speed_by_gender$sex == "male"] - speed_by_gender$mean_speed[speed_by_gender$sex == "female"], 1)` mph.

### Visualization

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5
ggplot(m111survey, aes(x = sex, y = fastest, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(
    title = "Fastest Speed Driven by Gender",
    x = "Gender",
    y = "Fastest Speed (mph)",
    fill = "Gender"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The boxplot shows that males not only have a higher median speed but also greater variability, with several outliers at the upper end exceeding 160 mph.

### Statistical Test

To determine if this difference is statistically significant, we perform a t-test:

```{r}
t_test_result <- t.test(fastest ~ sex, data = m111survey)
t_test_result
```

**Results:** The t-test reveals a statistically significant difference (p = `r round(t_test_result$p.value, 4)`) between males and females in fastest speeds driven. The 95% confidence interval suggests the true difference is between `r round(t_test_result$conf.int[1], 1)` and `r round(t_test_result$conf.int[2], 1)` mph.

## Relationship Between GPA and Speed

We also explored whether there is any relationship between academic performance (GPA) and driving behavior (fastest speed).

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 5
#| warning: false
ggplot(m111survey, aes(x = fastest, y = GPA, color = sex)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "GPA vs. Fastest Speed Driven",
    x = "Fastest Speed (mph)",
    y = "GPA",
    color = "Gender"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

**Observations:**

- There is no clear linear relationship between GPA and fastest speed driven
- Female students (pink points) cluster in the lower speed range (60-145 mph)
- Male students (teal points) are spread across a wider speed range, up to 190 mph
- GPAs appear fairly evenly distributed across different speed levels for both genders
- Academic performance does not appear to be related to driving behavior in this sample

## Conclusion

This analysis of the m111survey dataset revealed several interesting findings:

1. **Gender differences in driving behavior:** Males reported significantly faster speeds than females, with a mean difference of approximately 13 mph (p = 0.0086).

2. **No relationship between GPA and speed:** There was no apparent correlation between academic performance and the fastest speed driven, suggesting these behaviors are independent in this sample.

3. **Dataset characteristics:** The survey captured a diverse range of personal characteristics and beliefs from `r nrow(m111survey)` students, with minimal missing data and good representation of both genders.

Future analyses could explore other relationships in the dataset, such as the connection between sleep patterns and academic performance, or how personal beliefs correlate with other behaviors.
