## Introduction

This analysis examines book reviews from the `tigerData` package, which contains reviews of books on Amazon.com. Our research question is: **Which reviews contain the most links to other Amazon books?**

Reviews that link to other books often provide valuable context, comparisons, and recommendations. Identifying these highly-referenced reviews can help us understand which reviewers are most engaged with the broader book ecosystem.

## Data Loading and Exploration

First, we'll load the necessary packages and the reviews dataset:

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tigerData)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

# Load the reviews dataset
data(reviews)
```

Let's examine the structure of this dataset:

```{r}
glimpse(reviews)
```

The dataset contains `{r} nrow(reviews)` reviews across `{r} length(unique(reviews$book))` books, with columns for the book name, rating, URL fragment, review title, and the HTML content of the review.

Here's a sample of what the review content looks like:

```{r}
# Display a brief excerpt from one review with links
sample_review <- reviews$content[2]
substr(sample_review, 1, 500)
```

## Methodology

Amazon book links in the review content follow a specific HTML pattern. They appear as anchor tags with the structure:

```html
<a class="a-link-normal" href="/[book-path]/dp/[ASIN]">
```

The key identifier is `/dp/`, which indicates an Amazon product page. We can count these occurrences using regular expressions to determine how many other books each review references.

```{r}
# Count Amazon book links in each review
reviews_with_links <- reviews |>
  mutate(
    num_links = str_count(content, '<a class=.*?href=.*?/dp/')
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(num_links))
```

Let's look at the distribution of links across all reviews:

```{r}
# Summary statistics
summary(reviews_with_links$num_links)

# How many reviews have at least one link?
reviews_with_links |>
  summarise(
    total_reviews = n(),
    reviews_with_links = sum(num_links > 0),
    pct_with_links = round(100 * sum(num_links > 0) / n(), 1)
  )
```

## Results

### Top 10 Reviews with Most Amazon Book Links

Here are the ten reviews that reference the most other Amazon books:

```{r}
top_10 <- reviews_with_links |>
  head(10) |>
  select(book, rating, num_links, review_title)

top_10 |>
  mutate(rank = row_number()) |>
  select(rank, everything())
```

### Key Findings

The top findings from this analysis:

- **Tied for first place** with 9 links each are:
  - A review of *The Hunger Games* (5 stars): "A critical (and honest) review from a writer..."
  - A review of *Fifty Shades of Grey* (3 stars): "A Literary Forest Fire"

- The reviews span multiple books in the dataset, including *The Hunger Games*, *Fifty Shades of Grey*, and *The Fault in Our Stars*.

- The number of links ranges from 6 to 9 among the top 10 reviews.

- Reviews with many links tend to be longer, more analytical pieces that position the book within a broader literary context.

### Distribution by Book

Let's see which books in the dataset tend to have reviews with more cross-references:

```{r}
reviews_with_links |>
  group_by(book) |>
  summarise(
    total_reviews = n(),
    avg_links = round(mean(num_links), 2),
    max_links = max(num_links),
    reviews_with_links = sum(num_links > 0)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(avg_links))
```

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals that a small subset of Amazon book reviews are particularly rich in cross-references to other books. The top 10 reviews contain between 6 and 9 links to other Amazon books, suggesting that these reviewers take a comparative, contextual approach to their reviews.

Reviews with many links appear to be written by readers who:

- Have read widely in the genre
- Want to help other readers find similar books
- Position the reviewed book within a broader literary conversation
- Provide thoughtful comparisons and recommendations

These highly-linked reviews likely provide significant value to potential readers by offering curated reading lists and thoughtful literary context beyond a simple evaluation of the book being reviewed.
